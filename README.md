# Movies-ETL

In this module, the use of  Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is demonstrated to create data pipelines with data extracted 
from Wikipedia and Kaggle datasets from the MovieLensKaggle.Data pipelines transfer data from a source to a destination, 
and the process of ETL modifies the data along the way. Creating data pipelines is the primary step before an analyst 
proceeds with their analysis. As a result, ETL is very important.
